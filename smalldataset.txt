1	How moral judgment incongruence affects employee job crafting: The moderating roles of AI-generated ads' verisimilitude and creativity AI-Generated destination advertisement; Employee job crafting; Ethical acceptance; Moral congruence AI-powered destination advertising is reshaping tourism and hospitality. However, frontline employees often have differing moral judgments about generative AI (GenAI) advertising, creating challenges from intra-organizational moral incongruence. This research, based on social cognitive and cognitive rumination theories, examines how leader-employee moral incongruence over GenAI ads impact workplace outcomes and how ad features moderate these effects. A field survey of 941 hotel employees (Study 1) found that congruent moral judgments between leaders and employees foster approach job crafting while reducing avoidance job crafting. Two online experiments with 800 practitioners (Study 2) revealed that the negative effects of moral incongruence on approach job crafting are intensified by higher ad verisimilitude but mitigated by greater ad creativity. Moral incongruence also more strongly promotes avoidance job crafting when ad verisimilitude is high. Finally, a field experiment (Study 3) involving 826 leader-follower dyads in a travel agency corroborates these findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
2	How practitioners can leverage GenAI to bridge the research-practice gap GenAI; Knowledge translation process; Literature review; Research-practice gap; Toolkit Despite the practical relevance of many tourism research studies, organizations and policymakers often struggle to integrate them due to time constraints, language barriers, limited resources, and interaction challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new capabilities to overcome these barriers. We propose a GenAI-enabled knowledge translation process with three stages: (i) research curation to identify and translate relevant literature; (ii) content creation to produce materials; and (iii) market research using synthetic guests to pre-test their effectiveness. We examine the capabilities, limitations, and ethical implications of GenAI at each stage, drawing on a systematic review of GenAI and tourism literature. To equip managers with the knowledge and tools needed to harness research-based insights effectively, we offer a toolkit comprising a handbook, a promptbook, and tailored GPT models. The toolkit enables tourism and hospitality practitioners to apply research findings in their decision-making and content strategies without direct stakeholder interaction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
3	Empathy order effects on shaping GenAI online complaint management in tourism Attitude; Complaining practice; Customer satisfaction; Empathy; Generative artificial intelligence; Social exchange theory Recent studies have illuminated the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to influence customer behavior in tourism and hospitality. However, effective strategies for using GenAI to manage online customer complaints remain underexplored. This research examines how GenAI's empathy order (affective/cognitive vs. cognitive/affective) affects customer satisfaction and attitudes. Study 1 found that integrating both empathy types leads to higher satisfaction and more positive attitudes than using either type alone. Study 2 demonstrated that in support-seeking scenarios, both empathy orders elicited comparable satisfaction and attitudes, whereas in solution-seeking scenarios, the cognitive/affective empathy order was rated higher than the affective/cognitive order. Study 3 indicated that perceived competence and perceived warmth mediate these effects. This study deepens understanding of GenAI in online complaint management and offers actionable insights for leveraging empathy in online customer interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
4	AI as a cognitive collaborator: Assimilation and accommodation in human–machine teaming for innovation Assimilation and accommodation; Cognitive adaptation; Generative AI; Human–AI collaboration; Innovation performance This study investigates how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) transforms collaborative innovation by serving not only as a productivity tool but also as a cognitive partner in workplace problem-solving. Drawing on Piaget’s theory of assimilation and accommodation, we propose that the impact of GenAI depends on how users cognitively engage with it, either by fitting it into existing schemas (assimilation) or using it to restructure mental models and workflows (accommodation). To address our hypotheses, we conducted a randomized 2 × 2 factorial field experiment involving 371 professionals in South Korea to compare individuals and teams with or without access to GenAI. Participants completed an open-ended innovation challenge, and their cognitive strategies, emotional responses, and solution outcomes were measured using surveys, behavioral data, and expert evaluations. The results show that GenAI significantly improves innovation quality and emotional engagement, especially when users adopt accommodative strategies. Furthermore, accommodation mediates the integration of cross-functional knowledge, suggesting that cognitive adaptation is a critical mechanism for unlocking GenAI’s collaborative potential. These findings provide new theoretical insights into human–AI teaming, highlighting the importance of organizational support for cognitive flexibility in AI adoption. We conclude that GenAI’s value is maximized not through passive use, but through reflective collaboration and schema-level transformation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
5	Exploring the impact of diverse feedback sources on learners’ performance, motivation, and preference in a translation course: Tutor, peer, and GPT insight GPT feedback; Learning motivation and preference; Peer feedback; Translation performance; Tutor feedback Background Feedback, both human and computer-assisted, plays a critical role in scaffolding learners’ development, especially within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through interaction with more knowledgeable others. While recent studies have examined the role of Generative AI (GenAI) in supporting second language learning, its potential in translation pedagogy remains underexplored. Objectives This paper examines how GenAI feedback influences learners’ performance, motivation, and preferences in an ESL translation course. Based on the sociocultural theory, it emphasizes that all feedback sources should meet learners’ developmental needs. Methods This study adopted a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design, incorporating pre- and post-tests, a composite questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. A total of 84 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three ESL translation classes. At the initial stage, all participants received tutor feedback alongside unguided peer feedback. In the subsequent intervention phase, the Control Group (CG) continued with unguided peer feedback, the Experimental Group 1 (EG1) shifted to guided peer feedback, while the Experimental Group 2 (EG2) received AI-generated feedback in place of peer feedback. Tutor feedback remained consistent across all groups. This design facilitated both within-group and between-group comparisons, allowing the study to isolate the effects of feedback structure (guided vs. unguided peer feedback) and feedback source (peer/tutor vs. GenAI feedback). Results and conclusion The study found that guided peer feedback (EG1) led to the highest performance, significantly outperforming both unguided peer feedback (CG) and GenAI feedback (EG2). Although EG2’s performance lagged behind EG1, its learners showed the greatest increase in motivation. Feedback preferences ranked as: tutor > guided peer > GenAI > unguided peer. Learners appreciated GenAI’s accuracy, but noted issues such as limited creativity and emotional connection. The study suggests that human feedback, particularly guided peer and tutor feedback, provided stronger emotional support and adaptive scaffolding, fostering deeper cognitive engagement and a more empathetic environment compared to GenAI, which is correlated with higher performance and preference gains. While qualitative responses praised GenAI for accurate and comprehensive feedback, learners identified challenges such as information overload, limited creativity, and lack of emotional connection. The study suggests a hybrid feedback strategy integrating GenAI with human interactions to enhance translation pedagogy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
6	More inspiration and attention: How Generative AI tools impact graduate students' affective engagement in L2 source-based academic writing Adaptive learning; affective engagement; GenAI; L2 writing; Personalized education; Source-based academic writing Amidst the growing hype surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) for second language (L2) writing purposes, multiple studies have emerged, but few have emphasized its effects on students' affective engagement when they utilize it for source-based L2 academic writing. Against this backdrop, the present study employed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 81 participants in China to evaluate students' affective engagement through quantitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from stimulated recall with screencasts and semi-structured interviews. The findings show that traditional AI tools (e.g., DeepL) and GenAI tools show different effects on students' affective engagement across writing stages. GenAI tools, particularly when integrated with suggested prompts, significantly enhanced students' overall positive affect. Participants reported increased feelings of inspiration, alertness, attentiveness, and determination. However, qualitative analyses additionally revealed that students using suggested prompts experienced mixed emotions in later writing stages, particularly during revision, when AI outputs occasionally mismatched their individual needs and stylistic preferences. Moreover, students' affective engagement was dynamic, fluctuating across writing stages and prompt design and construction. This research offers insights for educators on how to effectively integrate GenAI into L2 writing classrooms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
7	Cheating Writing with Generative AI: Exploring Student Motivations Using the Theory of Planned Behavior Academic integrity; AI-assisted cheating; Cheating; Generative AI; Neutralization strategies Employing a qualitative research design utilizing semi-structured interviews we explored the motivations of Filipino undergraduate students who admitted to using generative AI (GenAI) to cheat in their writing. Using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework this study, we found that students reframed GenAI cheating as a legitimate academic survival strategy rather than misconduct. College students strategically used GenAI primarily in general education courses considered less relevant to career goals while developing complex evasion strategies combining multiple AI tools. Peer influence emerged as a powerful factor in normalizing GenAI cheating, with students learning techniques through social networks and interpreting institutional ambiguity as implicit approval. It revealed that students exhibit remarkably high confidence in their ability to use AI undetected, exploiting technological and generational gaps in academic integrity monitoring. The collective normalization of GenAI for cheating writing use creates descriptive norms that powerfully influence individual behavior. Students also interpreted the lack of clear institutional guidance as a silent approval of their actions. The findings challenge conventional academic integrity paradigms. We contend also that writing pedagogy requires reconceptualization to integrate AI tools ethically, while addressing systemic pressures driving students toward misconduct. We suggest that traditional punitive approaches to academic integrity are insufficient in the AI era. Educational institutions must shift toward proactive ethical education, AI literacy programs, and policy frameworks that acknowledge technological realities. The study contributes to understanding how generative AI influences academic integrity perceptions and provides insights for developing effective institutional responses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
8	Academic Integrity and Generative Artificial Intelligence –Views and Perceptions of Students in an Irish University Academic integrity; Generative artificial intelligence; Student perceptions; Student survey The development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT have transformed the academic landscape, offering learning opportunities while raising significant challenges regarding academic integrity. This study explores student perceptions and behaviours concerning academic integrity and the use of GenAI in the context of an Irish University, specifically MTU. It draws insights from a comprehensive survey of 608 students across various faculties and academic stages. Key findings reveal diverse views on the ethical use of GenAI, gaps in awareness of institutional integrity policies and a preference for institutional mechanisms to report misconduct while highlighting unwillingness to report it directly. The research highlights uncertainty regarding GenAI use among students, a pressing need for clear policy guidance, targeted integrity education, and structured support for ethical engagement with GenAI in higher education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
9	Exploring the role of GenAI self-efficacy in fostering university students’ creativity: An empirical study in Inner Mongolia and Taiwan Education resources; GenAI self-efficacy; General education courses; Generative artificial intelligence; Individual creativity This study investigates how internal and external educational resources shape college students’ generative AI (GenAI) self-efficacy and creativity across general education courses in business and technology, by comparing learners from Inner Mongolia and Taiwan. It assesses its role as a predictor of individual creativity. PLS-SEM was employed to test the proposed hypotheses and models. The findings reveal that students in both Inner Mongolia and Taiwan benefit from relatively comprehensive resource allocations in computing support, training, and equipment accessibility within their institutions. These resources significantly enhanced GenAI self-efficacy. However, computing training using external resources still needs to be developed for Inner Mongolia. Overall, the results confirmed that GenAI self-efficacy positively influenced student creativity. This study offers an empirical foundation for regional education policies. Educators should actively create a learning environment that can stimulate student creativity and use GenAI technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
10	Critical questioning with generative AI: Developing AI literacy in secondary education AI literacy; Critical questioning; Critical thinking; Generative AI; Human-AI Interaction The rapid integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education presents both opportunities and challenges in fostering critical questioning – a skill essential for critical thinking and AI literacy. In the context of GenAI, critical questioning refers to the ability to question, probe, and critically assess information generated by GenAI that will equip students with the discernment necessary in a digital world. However, there is limited research on how students develop and apply critical questioning when interacting with GenAI. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the pedagogical and contextual conditions that support high school students in critical questioning with GenAI. Through an action research study situated in a Grade 10 English classroom, the study examines the key conditions that facilitated students’ critical questioning with GenAI. Ethnographic methods were used to generate data from classroom observations, interviews, and student chatlogs that captured how students engaged with GenAI in situ within the classroom environment. A prior critical questioning framework was modified and used to identify instances of critical questioning with GenAI in the data, which were coded along the dimensions of context, delivery, and competency. Findings highlight how the instructional design of AI-mediated interactions, role of the teacher, students’ knowledge and disposition, and the delivery of GenAI platform were crucial in shaping the quality and depth of students’ questioning. These findings indicate that the success of critical engagement with GenAI does not rest on its technological capabilities alone, but on the specific pedagogical and classroom conditions that enable students to use it purposefully and reflectively. By extending our understanding of critical questioning in AI-mediated learning environments, this study provides insights into the conditions that foster AI literacy, which can lead to students actively and critically engaging with AI-generated content rather than passively consuming it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.	2026
