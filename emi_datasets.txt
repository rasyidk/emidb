1	Exploring EMI teachers' agency in addressing language-related challenges with ChatGPT: a multiple case study Teachers have begun to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT (hereafter, GPT), as pedagogical tools to help learners acquire English language skills. In English-medium instruction (EMI) classrooms, content teachers may lack sufficient and contextualized methods to address students' language challenges, which could impact both content and language learning outcomes. However, research on how EMI teachers use GenAI chatbots to accommodate language learning needs is limited. To fill this gap, the study adopts an ecological perspective of teacher agency to explore how three EMI content teachers exercised agency in using GPT to address language-related teaching challenges in their classrooms. The study further examines the factors influencing their agency. The data primarily consist of teachers' GPT interaction logs and responses from interviews regarding their experiences and perceptions of GPT. The findings reveal that the teachers exercised their agency by 1) addressing perceived language-related teaching challenges, 2) leveraging GPT affordances, and 3) mitigating school-level and GPT-level constraints. This study highlights the diverse and dynamic pathways of agency enactment, especially how they are influenced by teachers' past technology experiences, social contexts, evaluation of GPT affordances and constraints, and aspirations regarding students' success and personal growth. Notable, teachers' initial engagement with GPT and their ongoing evaluation in response to contextual constraints play a crucial and ongoing role. These insights can inform efforts to facilitate productive GPT-teacher collaborations in addressing language teaching issues in EMI contexts.

It explores how AI-powered tools, particularly ChatGPT, enable EMI teachers in Taiwan to leverage their expertise and teach in English with more confidence. This study first describes the training of an EMI PD programme. Then it reports on the challenges and strategies, and the extended and innovative use by EMI teachers after the training. By reporting on the experiences of three EMI teachers, this study shows how collaborating with ChatGPT contributes to developing an empowered EMI teacher identity. This study fills a research gap, shedding light on the transformative potential of collaborating with ChatGPT to transform content teachers' identities into an EMI teacher identity.
8	It becomes increasingly complex to deal with multiple channels': materialised communicative competence and digital inequality in English-medium higher education in the digital era This article explores university students' communicative competence for English-Medium Instruction (EMI) at a Swedish university in the era of digitalisation and blended learning. Based on a linguistic ethnography, we present an argument for communicative competence as repertoire assemblages orchestrating digital materiality and human language to construct meanings. The study shows how diverse digital multimodalities and AI-language tools are essential features of spatial repertoires for academic communication, and how they cooperate with and mediate students' personal repertoires to accomplish interactive learning tasks in EMI contexts. The study also highlights how digital diversity in EMI causes a 'digital divide', potentially impacting power relations among students. These findings underline the importance of acknowledging the communicative value of digital materiality and negotiating difference and normativity for intercultural academic communication in EMI.
9	Enhancing students' L2 writing by integrating artificial intelligence with corpus-based language pedagogy As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent, a range of benefits for student use has been recognised, such as providing instant feedback to support writing development. However, concerns persist about students' appropriate use of AI in academic writing. Corpora, offering an edge over AI in addressing some of these concerns in language classrooms, have proven effective in enhancing students' writing, particularly by improving the use of lexico-grammatical patterns, which highlights the importance of corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP). This study, therefore, aims to explore the potential of integrating AI with CBLP in L2 students' writing. The participants were 50 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners majoring in English at an English-Medium Instruction (EMI) university in China. They received corpus and AI training and then used their preferred corpus and AI tools in writing revision. During the revision, learners noted down the changes and the tools they referred to. After the revision, questionnaires were administered to examine learners' attitudes towards using the two types of tools and the combination of AI and corpora in writing revision, followed by semi-structured interviews to gain deeper insights. Learners' drafts and revisions were also collected for analysis to explore the changes made by AI and corpus tools. The results showed that learners successfully made a variety of changes in their revised drafts using corpus and AI tools and demonstrated their preferences in actual use: Corpus tools were more significantly used to refine collocations, while AI was more frequently employed for revising sentences. In general, learners held positive attitudes towards the two technologies and their integration in revision. For example, corpus tools were perceived as beneficial in enhancing collocational competence, while AI was considered valuable in generating immediate responses and refining sentences. The study contributes to our understanding of the potential for integrating AI and CBLP in students' L2 writing.
10	Advocating linguistic justice through digital multimodal composing against GenAI biases: a case study of multilingual youths in an EMI university The importance and challenge of advocating linguistic justice in universities where English is stipulated as the medium of instruction (EMI) are well documented. This study explores how a cohort of multilingual youths advocated linguistic justice by digital multimodal composing of video documentaries on linguistic racism with their lived experiences and GenAI tools. Following a case study design, multiple sources of data were collected, including semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, student-authored video documentary, and screen-recordings of the GenAI-assisted composing process. A combination of thematic and multimodal analysis demonstrates three forms of linguistic justice advocacy: challenging hiring bias in ELT professional contexts, representing English varieties in workplace, and exposing implicit linguistic racism. The findings also show that underneath the advocacy was multilingual youths' agentic multimodal composing across multiple GenAI platforms and against three GenAI biases: reproducing model English teacher stereotypes, hyper-reduction of linguistic diversity into a few dominant forms, and embedded platformised White standard English. We argue that for linguistic justice to be achieved in EMI settings, it is pivotal to support multilingual youths to capitalise on all their communicative repertories to multimodally compose not just with, but also against GenAI.
24	Exploring students' perspectives on Generative AI-assisted academic writing The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models (LLM), has merged to support students in their academic writing process. Keeping pace with the technical and educational landscape requires careful consideration of the opportunities and challenges that GenAI-assisted systems create within education. This serves as a useful and necessary starting point for fully leveraging its potential for learning and teaching. Hence, it is crucial to gather insights from diverse perspectives and use cases from actual users, particularly the unique voices and needs of student-users. Therefore, this study explored and examined students' perceptions and experiences about GenAI-assisted academic writing by conducting in-depth interviews with 20 Chinese students in higher education after completing academic writing tasks using a ChatGPT4-embedded writing system developed by the research team. The study found that students expected AI to serve multiple roles, including multi-tasking writing assistant, virtual tutor, and digital peer to support multifaceted writing processes and performance. Students perceived that GenAI-assisted writing could benefit them in three areas including the writing process, performance, and their affective domain. Meanwhile, they also identified AI-related, student-related, and task-related challenges that were experienced during the GenAI-assisted writing activity. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of GenAI's impact on academic writing that is inclusive of student perspectives, offering implications for educational AI design and instructional design.
11	Student perceptions of hybrid feedback: Using gen-AI to enhance engagement with EAP writing feedback Feedback is crucial in the learning process, yet many students struggle to engage with teacher feedback effectively. This study explores the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (gen-AI) to enhance student engagement with feedback in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing. Using a mixed-methods approach involving surveys and interviews with undergraduate students at a Sino-British transnational university where English is the medium of instruction (EMI), the research examines students’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement with feedback, with a particular focus on how gen-AI tools can help clarify and implement feedback. The findings suggest that students perceive the integration of gen-AI with teacher feedback as effective, with improvements observed in cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement, though behavioral engagement was slightly less pronounced. While the study highlights the potential benefits, it also identifies a range of concerns, indicating that a comprehensive approach is needed to address challenges related to integrating gen-AI in feedback processes. This research provides timely insights into how gen-AI can be used to foster students’ feedback engagement and enhance writing outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

This study investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence learning tools on students enrolled in English as Medium of Instruction (EMI) programs. It focuses on their academic understanding and engagement. The academic performance of the students within an EMI setting goes beyond their English proficiency. It is related to their ability to comprehend, interpret and analyze the content taught in English. Facing such a challenge may impact their motivation to study in English. This research provides a case study that explores the way Moroccan EMI students take advantage of AI-powered Tools through a tailored and interactive learning process. AI-powered Tools contribute to enhancing EMI students’ academic understanding and motivation. AI technologies raise serious concerns about their integration into the learning process. AI-powered Tools must be carefully integrated into EMI programs because they may hinder students’ autonomy, critical thinking, and academic integrity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
14	EAP teacher feedback in the age of AI: Supporting first-year students in EFL disciplinary writing Academic writing is a substantial component of tertiary education, yet it poses challenges for second/foreign language students, particularly first-year undergraduates with limited pre-university exposure to English-medium instruction (EMI) settings. In this context, English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers play a crucial role in supporting these students, but little is known regarding the nature of their feedback in scholarly literature. Complicating matters further is the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as a feedback tool, sparking ongoing debate about its efficacy in comparison with that of traditional human feedback. To address these gaps, this study investigated the nature of EAP teacher feedback on English as a foreign language (EFL) disciplinary writing, juxtaposing it against students’ perceptions of both EAP teacher feedback and AI-generated feedback. This study employed a three-layer coding scheme focusing on corrective, genre-specific, and intentional feedback to analyse the nature of EAP teacher feedback in detail. Through a comprehensive analysis of the interview themes, this study highlights the significance of EAP teacher feedback in the context of increasing integration of GenAI tools. The findings offer valuable insights into effective practices for supporting first-year EFL undergraduate students in their discipline-specific academic writing within EMI settings and demonstrate the critical role of EAP teacher feedback in assisting these students’ writing in an AI-prevalent world. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Suggestions for improvements to AI apps are also discussed to serve as a reference for future research. The findings also offer pedagogical implications for applying AI to speaking teaching. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
16	Whether English Proficiency and English Self-Efficacy Influence the Credibility of ChatGPT-Generated English Content of EMI Students This study investigated whether English proficiency (EP) and English self-efficacy (ESE) influence the credibility of ChatGPT-generated English content (CCGEC) of college students in the English-medium instruction (EMI) courses. We observed a college-level EMI course called “Technical Writing and Presentation”, where instructors encouraged their students of non-English majors to use ChatGPT for discovery learning in their EMI learning tasks. A survey of 800 students showed that ChatGPT was primarily used for providing explanations, suggesting ideas and structures, and preparing presentations. Analyzing the survey data with the MANCOVA procedure revealed that students' EP levels did not influence their CCGEC, and ESE did not moderate the relationship between EP and CCGEC in the EMI course context. These findings suggest that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for EMI students regardless of their EP or ESE. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
18	Multilingualism, translanguaging and transknowledging: Translation technology in EMI higher education Key findings, analysis and recommendations that have emerged from a research project, 'Using Human Language Technology to enhance academic integrity, inclusivity, knowledge exchange, student diversity and retention' at the University of South Australia conducted in 2019 are discussed in this article. The primary purpose of the project was to address some of the challenges and opportunities afforded by increasing student and teacher diversity at a predominantly English-medium Australian university through newly enhanced human language translation technology (HLT) also known as machine translation (MT). This technology is frequently used for the translation of human language, and it falls under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. From the institution's perspective, key aims of the project were to contribute to the university's Digital Learning Strategy priorities and core values embedded in a structural transformation of the university. These include integrity, accountability, diversity, social justice, engagement and collaboration. The researchers' objectives focussed on multilingual pedagogies using HLT to support knowledge exchange (transknowledging), and translanguaging for all students. These disrupt inequitable hierarchies, and position bi-/multilingual students as valuable resources for monolingual staff and students. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
20	Exploring genres with GenAI in an EMI academic writing course The implementation of English-medium instruction (EMI) in many Peruvian universities is a response to institutional aspirations related to internationalisation. In this changing context, the emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies also poses new challenges for teachers and students, particularly in an academic writing course. This study investigates how teachers can raise awareness among university students about ethical practices when using GenAI technologies, and how university students interact with GenAI tools. To this end, a learning experience titled ‘Exploring Language Narratives with GenAI’ was designed and applied in class. Findings point out that raising awareness in students about the ethical use of GenAI is difficult. Moreover, the inclusion of semi-controlled GenAI-enhanced activities can support other shortfalls that a student may present regarding language proficiency or course content. Finally, introducing GenAI tools in a class may aid teachers in addressing specific students’ learning needs, and may help to demystify teachers’ assumptions that GenAI technologies do it all. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
21	Harnessing english medium instruction and artificial intelligence for sustainable development goals: Implications for teacher professional development The globally eminent position of English has placed it as a language to study. This intensified utilisation of English in education has given rise to English medium instruction (EMI) where academic subjects are taught in English to the students whose L1 is not English. Using English as the medium enables the lecturers to address global issues. Considering that the World is facing sustainability issues, EMI is a key to promoting Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). Simultaneously, in the 2020s, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created opportunities and challenges for EMI. While it could improve instructional settings through enriching course content and teaching methods, it has also brought numerous ethical issues into the agenda, such as automated decision-making, bias, and discrimination. Therefore, this chapter provides recommendations for Teacher Professional Development Programs (TPDs) to inform educators, researchers, and policymakers in addressing SDGs effectively in EMI settings through AI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
23	Transnational higher education cultures and generative AI: a nominal group study for policy development in English medium instruction Purpose: This purpose of this paper is to report on the development of an evidence-informed framework created to facilitate the formulation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) academic integrity policy responses for English medium instruction (EMI) higher education, responding to both the bespoke challenges for the sector and longstanding calls to define and disseminate quality implementation good practice. Design/methodology/approach: A virtual nominal group technique engaged experts (n = 14) in idea generation, refinement and consensus building across asynchronous and synchronous stages. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. Findings: The GenAI Academic Integrity Policy Development Blueprint for EMI Tertiary Education is not a definitive mandate but represents a roadmap of inquiry for reflective deliberation as institutions chart their own courses in this complex terrain. Research limitations/implications: If repeated with varying expert panellists, findings may vary to a certain extent; thus, further research with a wider range of stakeholders may be necessary for additional validation. Practical implications: While grounded within the theoretical underpinnings of the field, the tool holds practical utility for stakeholders to develop bespoke policies and critically re-examine existing frameworks. Social implications: As texts produced by students using English as an additional language are at risk of being wrongly accused of GenAI-assisted plagiarism, owing to the limited efficacy of text classifiers such as Turnitin, the policy recommendations encapsulated in the blueprint aim to reduce potential bias and unfair treatment of students. Originality/value: The novel blueprint represents a step towards bridging concerning gaps in policy responses worldwide and aims to spark discussion and further much-needed scholarly exploration to this end. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
